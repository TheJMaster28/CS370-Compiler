# CS370 Compiler Final Project

This is the final project for my compiler class. Using lex and yacc, I was able to create a C-ALGOL-like compiler and produces the NASM assembly code, foo.asm. Source code can be type when running lab9 executable or send input file. Using an input test file, test.al, that takes two inputs through the compiler and running the NASM code produces the results:
